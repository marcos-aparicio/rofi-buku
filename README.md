# buku_run
rofi frontend for buku bookmarks manager

:warning:
Works on X11 environments but I haven't tested Wayland)

This is a fork from [this repo](https://github.com/carnager/buku_run) with some additional tweaks to the formatting and code so it is (in my opinion) a little bit more maintainable.

Props to [carnager](https://github.com/carnager) for the amazing script. Make sure to check him out if you are interested in Rofi scripts as he has more of those.
